Sahara
======

Tweaked version of the [desert256][1] colorscheme for Vim, without the clunky
color detection code. More subdued status bars, tab bars, and line numbers, and
some simple highlight grouping links to make HTML editing in particular look
just a bit less visually noisy than it does with the original colorscheme.
